## About
Stock Market Forecasting & Analysis is a project that uses time series analysis to show seasonal patterns and trends. I used time series values for forecasting most profitable stocks of 2019.

'*All_stocks_2010-2018*' is the dataset based on which the project has been built. The csv file can be found in the 'Dataset' directory of this repository.
